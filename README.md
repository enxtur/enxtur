## 👋 Hi, I'm Enkhtur

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience, mostly working on backend systems. I usually take a generalist approach — picking up whatever is needed to move a product forward and seeing features through from idea to production.

I care about building things that are useful, maintainable, and shaped by real usage rather than theory.
