## 👋 Hi, I'm Enkhtur

Product-focused software engineer with 10+ years of experience building and evolving production systems. I specialize in backend development but work as a **generalist** — owning features end-to-end, making product trade-offs, and shipping real user-facing systems.

I value long-term ownership, fast iteration, and learning from real-world consequences of technical decisions.

## 🧠 What I Do Best

- Own backend systems over multiple years, iterating based on production usage and real feedback  
- Design and evolve APIs and data models with a focus on correctness, performance, and clarity  
- Ship features independently in ambiguous, fast-moving environments  
- Debug and resolve production issues end-to-end  
- Balance engineering quality with product speed and constraints   -->
